/**
 * The single definition of what mutation testing mutates.
 *
 * It used to live inline in `stryker.config.mjs`, with `mutation-scope.ts`
 * keeping its own hand-copied `FULL_DATA_EXCLUSIONS` beside it. The two drifted
 * the moment either moved: a changed lane passes an explicit file list through
 * `FIT_MUTATION_SCOPE`, which replaces this glob outright, so an exclusion
 * added here was honoured by the full lane and ignored by every changed one.
 * Both now read this file, so there is nothing left to keep in step by hand.

// This gate enforces "reusable logic reaches the mutation score", so the glob
// has to select logic and leave out seed data. A mutant inside a fixture is not
// a defect the tests should catch: killing it would mean asserting the fixture's
// exact contents, which pins wording and sample numbers that are free to change.
// Everything that reads the data — indexes, scaling, macros, the parser, the
// adaptive TDEE model — is still mutated.
