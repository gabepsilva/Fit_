 * Whether `scripts/quality/mutation-verdict.ts` is the governing rule for this

 *
 * The break is the legacy full-tree defense and stays exactly that. On a
 * changed lane the verdict is harder than it on every file it judges: killed
 * only, where the break also credits a timeout; per file as well as in
 * aggregate; and no tolerance at all for a timeout or an uncovered mutant. It
 * also holds unchanged fallback files to this same 80 in their own pool.
 *
 * The single place the two part company is a file the verdict excuses because
 * the change never reached mutable code. There the break would re-impose the
 * whole-file debt the verdict just lifted, and from a pool that is often one
 * file, so the lane would still go red for a rewritten comment. Leaving it on
 * would make it, not the verdict, the rule that decides such a run.
