/**
 * Mutation testing needs thousands of cheap isolated runs; the browser project
 * gives expensive stateful ones, so the two do not belong in the same loop. The
 * DOM-free project is the mutation oracle and the browser project is left out.
 *
 * `groupOrder` above already established why: a mutant in a shared module is
 * covered by both projects, and once the fast spec fails to kill it the run
 * falls through to a Chromium boot. That boot does not fit the budget Stryker
 * derives from a per-test net time of milliseconds, so the mutant was recorded
 * as a Timeout — which Stryker credits as a kill while proving nothing. Ordering
 * the projects made the mutants the unit specs *do* catch die quickly; only
 * dropping the browser project fixes the ones they miss.
 *
 * The cost of this is real and deliberate: a mutant that only a browser spec
 * would have killed is now reported as Survived. That is the score this suite
 * always had, previously masked by timeouts counting as kills. It follows that
 * anything inside `mutate` in `stryker.config.mjs` needs a spec in
 * `DOM_FREE_CLIENT_SPECS`, or an explicit exclusion there saying why not.
 * `scripts/quality/mutation-oracle.ts` enforces that.
 *
 * `all` is spelled out for the same reason. It used to be absent, so the lookup
 * returned `undefined` and the full lane fell through to every project — which
 * put the browser back in the mutant loop for `test:mutation:full` and the
 * nightly gate, exactly the case the paragraphs above rule out.
