	 * much as the only thing it could be — `ssr` is off for both targets and the
	 * Capacitor build is static, so there is no server render to refuse. When the
	 * store starts fetching a journal, the endpoint behind it answers 401 to
	 * exactly the requests this hides, and that refusal is the real boundary.
	 *
	 * What it does buy is the product rule: nobody sees a page, a menu or a
	 * feature before they have signed in. Rendering nothing while the redirect
	 * runs is deliberate — a shell drawn first and replaced afterwards would show
	 * the journal it is meant to withhold.
	 *
	 * It is an effect rather than a `load` guard in `+layout.ts`, and that is the
	 * deliberate half of the design. A `load` guard runs on entry and on
	 * navigation, which are only one of the three ways someone ends up on the
	 * wrong side of this line: the other two are signing out and the expiry
	 * above, both of which change the session while the page sits still. One
	 * rule that watches the state covers all three; a `load` guard would cover
	 * the first and need a second mechanism for the rest.

			the message with it.

			`fixed bottom-0` and `LogSheet` raises six of these from inside it;
			`Onboarding` pins its actions there with `sticky bottom-0`. On a phone
