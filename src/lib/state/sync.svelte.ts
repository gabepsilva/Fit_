 * that can lose somebody's data — which copy wins when the two disagree. Four
 * rules cover that:
 *
 * 1. A device with a document of its own and a server with none pushes. That is
 *    how every device predating sync migrates, and there is one chance at it per
 *    device: adopting an empty server would empty the phone instead.
 * 2. A device the server refuses as stale adopts what came back and says so. It
 *    never merges and never overwrites; merging is a later story, and silence is
 *    what would make the loss invisible.
 * 3. Nothing is marked sent until a write carrying it has been accepted.
 * 4. An answer that arrives after this device signed out is not acted on.
 *
 * The whole `TendState` document is synced, `onboarded` and `activeProfileId`
 * included: with one account per household both belong to the account rather
 * than to the device.
