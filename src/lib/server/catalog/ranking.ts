 *
 * Three passes, and the order of the last two is the whole of issue #106. The
 * first scores every matched row on terms that cost a comparison each. The
 * second collapses rows sharing a name, over the best `DEDUP_DEPTH` of them:
 * without it "milk" answers with five dairies' rows all named "MILK" and a
 * person sees one food five times. The third splits each surviving name into
 * its comma-separated parts and applies the processed-form and byproduct
 * penalty, over `SHORTLIST` rows rather than all of them.
 *
 * The collapse has to come before the cut, not after it. Cutting first is what
 * made "pasta" answer with one row: the hundreds of branded rows all named
 * "PASTA" filled the shortlist and then became one. Nothing is lost by
 * collapsing first, because the penalty the third pass applies is a function of
 * the name, so it is the same for every row the collapse is choosing between.
