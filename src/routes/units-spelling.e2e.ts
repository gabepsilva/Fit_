/**
 * Issue #111: "2 tablespoons olive oil" was logged as 2 servings — the whole
 * bottle's worth, one serving at a time — instead of 2 tablespoons, because
 * `classifyUnit` did not accept the long spelling `portions.ts` already
 * accepted on a catalog label. Drives the real Log sheet end to end and
 * checks the same kcal `LogSheet.svelte.spec.ts` asserts for the short form
 * "2 tbsp olive oil" (238 kcal: olive oil is a 14 g, 119 kcal tablespoon).
