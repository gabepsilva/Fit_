/**
 * The reporting half of the scheduled mutation audit.
 *
 * Those lanes no longer fail a build -- Gabriel's decision on 2026-09-04 was to
 * pay mutation debt daily rather than block on it -- so a non-zero exit from a
 * lane now goes nowhere on its own. This reads what each lane wrote and turns
 * it into one Markdown report naming the mutants that were not killed, so the
 * debt reaches a person through a GitHub issue instead of dying with the exit
 * code. A lane that swallowed its failure and printed nothing would be worth
 * less than not running it.
 *
 * It always exits 0: it reports debt, it is not a gate.
 *
 * **Old rule (through 2026-09-04):** a lane counted as debt only when its own
 * verdict failed -- the full lane's aggregate score below 80%, a changed lane
 * below its strict floor. Issue #87 found that gave the full lane nothing to
 * report: 96.68% clears 80% easily no matter how many of its 143 survivors,
 * uncovered and timed-out mutants sit underneath it, so the daily debt queue
 * this system exists to feed was permanently empty.
 *
 * **New rule (2026-09-05, issue #87, option 1):** every survivor is debt,
 * regardless of aggregate score. A lane with one uncovered mutant is not
 * "clean" merely because its score still clears the bar.
